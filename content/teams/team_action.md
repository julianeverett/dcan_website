### Goals

The Action Team acts as the Steering Group for Dorset CAN. It sets the general direction of Dorset CAN, the priorities, allocates resources and provides coordination for the teams, members and supporters.

### Activities

The Action Team is made up of the coordinators of all the other teams plus the overall coordinators who volunteer on a rotating basis.

### Schedule & Time Commitment

The Action team meets weekly to keep things on track. It also arranges regular wider outreach events including collaborations with external partners who share our goals. The Action Team is open to all members to attend.

### Achievements

1. Founded the organisation in June 2021 with founder members
2. Produced a constitution for an unincorporated association and core values statement
3. Agreed and keeps under review strategic aims
4. Provides regular monitoring, plans and encouragement for the achievement of the aims
5. Ensures funds and other resources are secured for the delivery of the aims

### What's next?

We're registering as a charity and applying for funding so we can do more good stuff.
