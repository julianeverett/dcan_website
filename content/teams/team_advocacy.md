### **What have we done so far?**

* Prepared – in consultation with many Dorset CAN members and other organisations – Dorset CAN’s formal response to the draft Climate and Ecological Emergency Strategy published by Dorset Council.
* Prepared – again in consultation with many Dorset CAN members and other organisations – Dorset CAN’s formal response to the draft Dorset Local Plan.
* Through the Dorset Deserves Better campaign secured a rethink on the Local Plan.
* Engaged 64 organisations, including 23 Town and Parish Councils (in total representing 109,000 people) in the Dorset Deserves Better campaign
* Maintained a dialogue with Dorset Council on the Local Plan and the CEES.

### **What are we doing now and what's next?**

* Aiming to get a good outcome to the rethink of the Local Plan - one that leads to a new Plan without substantial delay, in line with the Climate & Ecological Strategy


* We may become involved in further advocacy activity related to the Climate and Ecological Emergency Strategy : we are keeping a close eye on the Council’s action.

### **Interested in getting involved?**

* We warmly welcome contributions from all Dorset CAN members and related organisations to the campaign focused on the Dorset Local Plan.

### Policy Successes

1. Submission of strong, constructive proposals to Dorset Council's public consultation on the Climate and Ecological Emergency Strategy.
2. Forming a powerful, collective response to the Local Plan public consultation by collating responses from over 30 organisations throughout Dorset.
3. Gaining press and media attention on our response to the Local Plan, enabling better public awareness of the issues around housing, protection of green spaces and climate action.
4. Asking questions at Dorset Council meetings to encourage better communication and enabling Dorset CAN to share information with members and the public.
