### What have we done so far?

Established the function of the land use group is to act as a network to support and enable local projects in the following areas:

* This team leads work on the Great Big Dorset Hedge project, including accessing funding for it, engaging local communities and carrying out mapping and survey work
* Tree protection - understanding the regulations and how to defend our trees
* Lifelines projects- encouraging community interaction, investigating the use of herbicides / pesticides and alternative practices
* Wildlife restoration networks / corridors
* Food production - sustainable local production methods.

In July 2021, we ran an online meeting on **Food Systems & Forest Gardens: how to make change happen in your community**. [**See a report of the meeting here.**](https://www.dorsetcan.org/uploads/1/3/9/6/13969833/meeting_report_8.7.21.pdf)

### What are we doing now and what's next?

* Focusing on tree and hedgerow projects as grants are available now and need to be applied for.
* Establishing a database of information links.

### **What’s next/future plans?**

* The Great Big Dorset Hedge
* Focus on sustainable food systems
* Continue to gather data on the different aspects of Land Use related projects
* Future plans / visions:
* Clean Rivers and Seas
* Locally produced food without plastic packaging
* Trees genuinely protected
* Farming without reliance on pesticides and herbicides

###

Interested in getting involved?

We need help with submitting info onto a database (call Julie 07791741687).
Experts in mapping would also be useful as map analysis is a useful basis for many land use projects.​

Contact Julie or Ian if you'd like to join the Land-use Team.

### Policy Successes

1. Held an open event on **Land Use and Biodiversity**
2. Hosted a presentation by the **Dorset National Park Team**
3. Ran an online meeting on **Food Systems & Forest Gardens: how to make change happen in your community**
