### **What have we done so far?**

* At our initial meeting we all put forward ideas we thought the Transport Group might work on, and came up with a list of 9 possible topics.
* Since then we have been educating ourselves about transport, using information such as government publications, e.g. Gear change and Bus back better, Dorset Council Documents e.g Bournemouth, Poole and Dorset Local Transport Plan 3, and sharing knowledge and links between ourselves.
* We contributed to the Dorset CAN Dorset Local Plan consultation submission.
* We contributed to the Travel Better chapter of Zero Carbon Dorset’s “Dorset 2030” Report.

### **What are we doing now and what's next?**

* We are building relationships with Dorset Transport Action Groups, with several group members having joined the Transport Team.
* At our last meeting we debated our list of nine ideas and decided to focus on three interrelated ideas - provision of expertise to DC and BCP, contributing to the next Local Transport Plan, and developing local Transport Strategies.
