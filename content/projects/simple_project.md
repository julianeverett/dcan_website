We now have 64 organisations including 23 Town and Parish Councils representing over 109,000 residents of Dorset working within our Alliance to improve the _Dorset Local Plan_.

### Sample Project

**Dorset Deserves Better (DDB)** is an alliance to suggests ways to transform the the widely criticised _Dorset Local Plan_ (of March 2021) into a visionary programme that enriches the county and serves the people of Dorset – especially the young and those most in need.

### What can I do?

2. **Contact your Dorset Councillor and your parish/town council.** Tell them in your own words why you object to the _Local Plan_. Urge them to put pressure on Dorset Council to change the _Local Plan_ along the lines suggested in our Jan 2022 [Open Letter](/uploads/ddb_open_letter.pdf).
