    and have worked in the environmental voluntary sector at a senior level for over
    30 years. Taking care of our environment is about taking care of ourselves - if
    we don't we are sawing off the branch we're sitting on. We are literally on the
    brink of environmental chaos and we must do everything we can to stop that from
    happening.

  description: 'I came to eco-activism late in my career having worked for may years
    as a geophysicist in the Energy Industry. The science is clear that global warming
    is taking place but I guess I thought that a bit more CO2 in the atmosphere would
    help plants to grow and that a bit of extra warmth would not do too much harm.
    I now know how wrong I was. The loss of the biodiversity is shocking and the speed
    at which changes are happening is having a brutal impact on the whole world. It
    is now up to all of us to do something, however small, to address the issues and
    to try to protect the planet from the worst impacts of human expansion and climate
    change. Each one of us really can all make a difference - especially at a local
    level. '

  description: I have a keen interest in transport, being a 4th generation railway
    worker, and I have spent my professional career as a Railway Signal Engineer.  I
    believe that changing the way we move around is key to reducing our greenhouse
    gas emissions - did you know that transport accounts for around a third of UK
    / Dorset Council carbon emissions?  I am keen to do what I can to help reduce
    this, while improving access to public transport and safe active travel not just
    for recreation and tourism but as a viable alternative to private cars for travel
    to work and education.  Travelling to our future destinations in a sustainable
    way! Co-ordinating, motivating and inspiring expertise, collaboration and community
    energy.

    feel acutely, the destruction we humans have caused and recognise that l have
    a responsibility and duty to leave the planet in a better state for the next generation.
    I also want to understand why we humans, despite knowing that the consequences
    of our behaviour threaten our very existence, continue to treat the world and
    all her resources with such self-centred contempt.

    was the birth of his son that energised  him into doing something about it. He
    is driven by the questions his son will ask in the future "Dad why didn''t you
    do anything knowing what you knew!" Rob was attracted to Dorset CAN''s mission
    of bringing the whole of Dorset together to take positive action to address Climate
    Change locally. By being part of the Dorset CAN, Rob feels he can leave a positive
    legacy for his son and community and be able to say to his son "I did something".
