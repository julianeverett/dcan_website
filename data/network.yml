    description: >-
      Hazelbury Bryan is a large parish of 997 hectares (2,415 acres) in the
      south-west of the Blackmore Vale.  It is bounded to the north by Ridge
      Drove, Smetherd Farm and Deadmoor Common, by Mount Pleasant Farm on the
      east, Park Gate to the South and a tributary of the River Lydden in the
      west, joining the Lydden itself south of Lyddon House.

      The village comprises seven separate hamlets of Kingston, Wonston (and
      Pleck), Pidney, Partway, Woodrow, Droop and Park Gate, with open fields
      between them.  This arrangement is unusual, if not unique, in Dorset.

      In 2011, and again in 2016, the residents of Hazelbury Bryan were asked
      what was important about the area. Not surprisingly on both occasions the
      answers were very similar - location and environment and the sense of
      community.

      I've painted the peat bogs to show that they have a beauty of their own,

      as a sink for water and greenhouse gasses. I also like to create banners
