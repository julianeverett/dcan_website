donateText: "Thanks to you, we've just (autumn 2022) raised the money to pay a part-time co-ordinator and administrator. But we have urgent work to do as global issues (climate crisis and biodiversity loss) combine with local issues (the risk of fracking in Dorset, mounting levels of pollution in the county's rivers, our vulnerability to building development in our precious greenbelt) and national issues (the energy and cost of living crisis).

  We are engaging directly with Dorset Council on a range of crucial issues and taking our message to local residents and businesses - but we need to ask for your help. Could you make a donation? Even £10 would help us to focus on the projects and campaigns that need our attention - getting local homes insulated, campaigning to get the right new homes built, working with Wessex Water and the Environment Agency on our rivers, recording, mapping and extending hedges across the county...

  If you can help us, please make a donation today. We promise to spend every penny of it helping to address the climate and ecological emergency that we face here in Dorset."
