  Thanks to you, we've just (autumn 2022) raised the money to pay a part-time
  co-ordinator and administrator. But we have urgent work to do as global issues
  (climate crisis and biodiversity loss) combine with local issues (the risk of
  fracking in Dorset, mounting levels of pollution in the county's rivers, our
  vulnerability to building development in our precious greenbelt) and national
  issues (the energy and cost of living crisis).

  We are engaging directly with Dorset Council on a range of crucial issues and
  taking our message to local residents and businesses - but we need to ask for
  your help. Could you make a donation? Even Â£10 would help us to focus on the
  projects and campaigns that need our attention - getting local homes
  insulated, campaigning to get the right new homes built, working with Wessex
  Water and the Environment Agency on our rivers, recording, mapping and
  extending hedges across the county...

  If you can help us, please make a donation today. We promise to spend every
  penny of it helping to address the climate and ecological emergency that we
  face here in Dorset.
